<h1>Journal</h1>
I started from a layout for the keyboard, looking at designs like 100%, 85%, 70%, 65% and 65% looked the best to me.<br>
So, with some guides, I started with the schematic in KiCad 9.0.<br><br>

After placing everything systematically, it looked like this!

Time Spent: 30 mins<br>

<h3>Wiring Time!</h3>
After wiring every component in the schematic, it came out like this

Time spent: 45 mins<br>
<b>**Total time: 1hr 15mins**</b>

<h2>Placing the components on the pcb</h2>
After turning the schematic into a PCB, I started placing the components on the PCB in order of the 65% keyboard I planned to make. Did not remember to get a screenshot of the process
Time spent: 1hr 30mins<br>
<b>**Total time: 2hr 45mins**</b>

<h2>Time to Route everything!</h2>
After finally placing the components with the correct spacing and order, I had to do the routings. It was a very long process and indeed took a very long time. I had to adjust the routings accordingly to be able to place vias, turn the layer while routing, leave space for the routes to change layers, and more.

<h2>Case Designing Time!</h2>
For this case, I decided to use only a bottom case as an open PCB looks very beautiful.

After extruding the PCB, I made some designs on the sides of the case.<br>
