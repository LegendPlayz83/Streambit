# Inspiration
I've always wanted to build a keyboard, and Grounded gave me the perfect opportunity to turn this into reality.

# Challenges
This was the first time using some new libraries. Although I did run into some issues, the issues were resolved on the channel <a href="hackclub.slack.com/archives/C0948RT0C1M">Grounded</a>.
